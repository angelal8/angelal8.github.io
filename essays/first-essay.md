- Hi everyone. My name is Angela and I am an undergraduate student here at Shidler. Even though I am a Finance student, I decided to take ITM 352 because I thought it would be a good way for me to learn some skills that would be useful for me in the future after college. I also have a slight interest in majoring in MIS along with getting my Finance degree as well. Taking this class will be a great opportunity for me to learn more about coding and the various things I can do with everything I learn in this class. 
-
- I do have some experience in coding because I majored in computer science my freshman year, but I do not remember much of the Java language. Hopefully through this class, I can get back on track and take programming seriously.
-
- With that said, I look forward to learning more programming skills in ITM 352 to help me gain knowledge for my future career and hopefully I will major in MIS as well.
