I recently just completed my first three sets of WODs and I can conclude that they are very hard to do since I am still new to coding. They did take up a lot of time, especially browser history 1, so they were not easy to complete. Even though I watched the screencast, I was still very forgetful of the steps while retrying the WODs, so that took up a lot of time as well. Browser history 1 was definitely the WOD that I spent the most time on, and maybe I will go back and retry it so I can complete it in less than 10 minutes.

To me, the easiest browser history so far was browser history 2. I took the shortest amount of tries and the least amount of time on browser history 2 and I think the reason was because it was a lot more relaxing and short compared to the other two. I think something that I struggled on other than remembering what to do next was remembering to put semi-colons where they belonged and remembering to properly place quotations. These are small things, but they are also reasons why I took longer on the WODs like browser history 1.

One piece of advice that I will give is that it is important to start on these assignments early because they do take up a lot of time. But after doing them more than at least 3-5 times, writing code in CSS and HTML should be more comfortable.
