At this point of the class, I have completed about five WODS, but I have yet to master all of them, especially the recents WODs. Browser History 1-3, 6 were simple WODs because they were built off each other, yet at the same time were very difficult at the beginning. https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html

For the WODs, what worked well was watching the screencast first even though we should've done it on our own. I think watching the screencast first helped prepare me for what I should expect throughout completing the WODs, and it also helped me redo the WODs faster. I think for all of the WODs, the thing I stumbled on most and slowed me down was not knowing where to start, which again is why I thought watching the screencast helped a lot. 

In order to prepare for the WODs, I watched the screencast so I know what to expect. From the WODs before this, I watched the screencast prior and during as well. I didn't do anything much different, so that is something I should work on in order to improve my coding and problem solving skills.

What I could've done to better prepare for the WODs is to start early. It is easier said than done, but doing the WODs last minute really makes it hard to do it proficiently and with quality, which forces me to redo the WODs a lot. Thus resulting in putting in a lot of time to complete the WODs in a timely manner. For future WODs, and for WODs that I plan on redoing, I would want to time manage better and read the instructions carefully so I know what to do on my own. For future WODs, I will try not to watch the screencast first and try to work on the problem on my own first.
