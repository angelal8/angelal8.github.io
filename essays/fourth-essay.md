I would say that compared to the beginning of the semester, my programming skills have greatly improved. Before, I didn't even know what a lot of the vocabulary and lines of code meant but now I am starting to feel more comfortable looking at code.

I am not 100% enthusiastic about programming if I am being honest, but I do find it relieving when I figure out something that I struggled on for a long time.

Compared to the beginning of the semester, I feel like I can do the WODs at a more comfortable pace. The beginning WODs, I can definitely do without looking at the screencasts, but the recent WODs, I do need to refer to the screencast solutions to complete them.

The labs do definitely help me learn how to code and I am able to complete some of them with confidence as sometimes, the questions could be difficult to understand as I am not confident in coding.

I'm not super confident, but I think I'll be able to move onto the next stage of complexity in programming.

I think we could spend more time doing the labs instead of going through it super fast and moving onto the next one.

Going through the labs are super helpful in class since I can follow along.
