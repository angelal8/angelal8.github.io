A: The design for my site's shopping cart by adding forms onto the previous assignment 2 to allow a user to shop at an actual online site. To support this, we will use form processing to allow a user to login with an account or register for a new account in order to complete their purchase of their choice. We will continue using a .json file in order to run the user information.

B: I will use sessions to manage my shopping cart by seeing what products our customer is interested in, so once they select the amount that they want, we can keep track of it on our invoice page. Also, we will use sessions so that when a customer returns to their shopping cart after a purchase, the cart will then be empty to allow for a new purchase.

C: I will avoid access to my application when the user has not logged in by incorporating a form to validate a users' login information to prevent any mistakes. For security measures, we will try to write a code that automatically logs out a user after a certain amount time to protect their information.

D: Upon a successful login, it will take the user to the invoice page, where it confirms a customer's order. It will then have a button taking them back to the home page if they would like to do so.

E: Since I am working with a partner, we will both be working on using sessions and cookies for our site and incorporating multi-dimensional arrays to our site as well. Since it is easy to design a website, we both will be working on the CSS style of our site and writing up the HTML code.

F: I am approaching assignment 3 differently than assignment 2 by starting early and debugging my code once at a time instead of writing the code all at once and then debugging it.
