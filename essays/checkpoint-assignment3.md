The design for my site's shopping cart by adding forms onto the previous assignment 2 to allow a user to shop at an actual online site.

I will use sessions to manage my shopping cart by 

I will avoid access to my application when the user has not logged in by incorporating a form to validate a users' login information to prevent any mistakes. For security measures, we will try to write a code that automatically logs out a user after a certain amount time to protect their information.

Upon a successful login, it will take the user to the invoice page, where it confirms a customer's order. It will then have a button taking them back to the home page if they would like to do so.

Since I am working with a partner, we will both be working on using sessions and cookies for our site and incorporating multi-dimensional arrays to our site as well. Since it is easy to design a website, we both will be working on the CSS style of our site and writing up the HTML code.

I am approaching assignment 3 differently than assignment 2 by starting early and debugging my code once at a time instead of writing the code all at once and then debugging it.
