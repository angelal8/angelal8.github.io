To give a brief introduction to assignment 2, it is basically an assignment that added onto assignment 1 but with a login and registration page for customers to enter in as well. We had to make sure the customer inputed a valid login in order to go through with the product order.

From this assignment, I learned how to make a user login and registration page. We needed code from prior pages in order to move onto creating these two pages.

No, I did not work with a partner as it was not mentioned in class that we could have.

I did not get the helpe I needed because I did not ask.

Developing this assignment was different than assignment 1 because we had to pass data from the order page and take the user to the login and registration page in order to access the invoice page, so there was a lot more work that had to be done.

At the time of writing this, I would say I spent 15% thinking about how to do something, 20% writing code, and 65% of the time testing an debugging.

Not a lot of things worked well with this project. It was very hard and I felt like we weren't given a lot of time to work on it. I was also not confident with the code that I've written up.

If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would definitely ask for help and start on this assignment earlier as it takes up a lot of time and writing the code for the login and registration page is quite difficult.
